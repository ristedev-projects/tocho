    "description": "At Tocho, our story begins in Oaxaca, Mexico, where food is more than just a meal—it's family, tradition, and culture. In the late 1990s, our family migrated to the United States in search of a better life, eventually making our home in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We quickly realized that the rich flavors and traditions of Oaxacan cuisine were hard to find this far north, and we felt called to change that. Tocho was born from our desire to share the foods we gew up loving blending authentic Oaxacan recipes with the fast approachable style of American dining. It's our way of honoring our roots while embracing our new home. We love Fort Wayne and are proud to serve this community. We invite you to experience a taste of Oaxaca—made with heart, heritage, and a whole lot of flavor.",
